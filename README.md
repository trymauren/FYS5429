This is the repo for the first project in FYS5429. It may contain both projects later.
The initial goal is to build a recursive neural network (rnn) from scratch. Hopefully,
we are able to also extend the rnn implementation to a long short term memory (LSTM)
neural network implementation.

All common functions and Classes resides in `utils`. `rnn` contains the rnn code. 
`lstm` contains the lstm code. `Data` contains all data used for training the networks.
